        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">My name is Drake Burrington and I am 17 years old and I live in Southside Richmond. I am an 11th grader at CodeRVA and I am going to graduate in 2021. I am currently doing a simulated internship with Maxxpotential. CodeRVA is a new computer science school in Northside Richmond, which focuses on blended learning and computer science. Some hobbies I have include skateboarding, working out, driving, hiking, playing video games. Some things I am passionate about are traveling, seeing my friends and family, trying new things, the outdoors.</p>
        <p>Goals I have for the future include seeing the world, managing or owning a business, and being happy with what I do.</p>

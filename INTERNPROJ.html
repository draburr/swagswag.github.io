        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In my 9th grade year I took python with turtle, and in my 10th grade year I took python. This year in 11th grade I am taking HTML. Below there will be numerous projects I have done over the years.</p>
        
        <p>This python project is math practice where the user can pick a subject and keep answering the questions till they get one wrong, they then have the choice to keep going or end the game:</p>

        <p>Another assignment I did in python was a math test, the user would be asked how many questions they wanted and if they want squared or cubed problems. The quiz restarts if the user does not score above an 80%:</p>

        <p>Another python project was to make a cash register and enter in prices for how many items the user inputed and then give them the total including tax:</p>

        <p>I did a project in HTML when we first started using css with just using colors. It was about jelly Beans:</p>
